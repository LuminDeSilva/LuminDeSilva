# Hi there, I'm Lumin! üëã

## üöÄ About Me

I am a passionate Software Engineer with a solid foundation in SRE, full-stack development and DevOps practices. I thrive on solving complex problems and building scalable, efficient solutions.

In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy learning new tools and technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. When I‚Äôm not coding, I explore ways to share knowledge and give back to the tech community.
