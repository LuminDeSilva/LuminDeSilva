# Hi there, I'm Lumin! üëã

## üöÄ About Me

I‚Äôm a DevOps Engineer with expertise in SRE, Linux system administration, and building robust CI/CD pipelines. Skilled in containerization using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes. I have hands-on experience across major cloud platforms including AWS, Azure, and GCP. Passionate about designing and developing scalable, complex architectures. I‚Äôm also curious by nature‚Äîactively exploring, building, and contributing to open source tools.

In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy learning new tools and technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. When I‚Äôm not coding, I explore ways to share knowledge and give back to the tech community.
